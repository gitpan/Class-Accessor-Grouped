Revision history for Class::Accessor::Grouped.

0.10010 2013-04-24 02:58 (UTC)
    - Fix bug with identically-named 'simple' accessors in different
      classes set to access *differently named fields* getting their
      field access mixed up
    - Fix subtle pessimization when having identically-named accessors
      in different classes leads to 'simple' implementations not being
      replaced by Class::XSAccessor where appropriate

0.10009 2012-11-15 18:51 (UTC)

    - Switch all module loading to Module::Runtime and lose
